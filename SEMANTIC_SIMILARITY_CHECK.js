Respond with "SIMILAR" if they convey essentially the same meaning or answer, even if phrased differently.
Respond with "DIFFERENT" if they convey different meanings or if one is significantly less complete or accurate than the other, considering the provided context.
Focus on meaning, not just keyword overlap.
Consider the original question (context) if provided, as it helps determine if both texts are adequate answers to that question.`,

Text 1 (Expected Answer): "{{text1}}"
Text 2 (Actual Answer): "{{text2}}"

Are Text 1 and Text 2 semantically SIMILAR or DIFFERENT in the context of the original question?
Your response should be a single word: SIMILAR or DIFFERENT.`,
