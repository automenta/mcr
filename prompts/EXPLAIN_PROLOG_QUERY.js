Given a natural language question, its translation into a Prolog query, the facts currently in the session, and any relevant global ontology rules, provide a clear, step-by-step explanation.
- Describe what the query is asking for in the context of the provided knowledge.
- Explain how the Prolog engine would attempt to match the query against the facts and rules.
- Mention which specific facts or rules would be relevant to satisfying the query.
- If variables are involved, explain how they would get instantiated.
- Conclude with what kind of result (e.g., true/false, specific values) one might expect.
- Do not actually execute the query; explain the process.
- Be clear and pedagogical.`,
