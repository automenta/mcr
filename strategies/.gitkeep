# This file is intentionally blank.
# It ensures the 'strategies' directory is created and tracked by Git,
# even if it's initially empty or only contains JSON files that might be
# ignored by some configurations.
#
# Please place your JSON strategy definition files in this directory.
# Example:
# strategies/
#   sir-r1-strategy.json
#   direct-s1-strategy.json
#
# Each JSON file should define a strategy graph according to the MCR Evolution Engine specification.
# Key fields include:
# - id: Unique identifier for the strategy (string).
# - name: Human-readable name (string).
# - description: Brief explanation of the strategy (string).
# - nodes: Array of node objects defining the steps in the workflow.
#   - id: Unique ID for the node (string).
#   - type: Type of the node (e.g., "LLM_Call", "Parse_JSON", "SIR_To_Prolog").
#   - ... other type-specific properties (e.g., prompt_template_name, input_variable, output_variable).
# - edges: Array of edge objects defining connections between nodes.
#   - from: ID of the source node (string).
#   - to: ID of the target node (string).
# - result_variable: (Optional) The name of the variable in the execution state that holds the final output of the strategy.
#
# Refer to the system specification for more details on the JSON schema.
