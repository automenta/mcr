**Key Principles for Translation:**
1.  **Fact vs. Rule:** Classify input as a single 'fact' or a single 'rule'.
    *   Specific statements about entities (e.g., "The Moon orbits the Earth") are FACTS.
    *   General statements about categories (e.g., "Birds fly") are RULES.
2.  **Predicate Consistency:**
    *   **Class Membership:** "Socrates is a human." -> \`{"statementType": "fact", "fact": {"predicate": "is_a", "arguments": ["socrates", "human"]}}\`
    *   **Definitions/Identities:** "Water is H2O." -> \`{"statementType": "fact", "fact": {"predicate": "defines", "arguments": ["water", "h2o"]}}\` (CommonName, SymbolOrFormula)
    *   **Relational Phrases:** "John is Mary's father." -> \`{"statementType": "fact", "fact": {"predicate": "father_of", "arguments": ["john", "mary"]}}\`
    *   **Composition:** "H2O is composed of Hydrogen and Oxygen." -> \`{"statementType": "fact", "fact": {"predicate": "is_composed_of", "arguments": ["h2o", ["hydrogen", "oxygen"]]}}\`
    *   **Simple Attributes:** "The sky is blue." -> \`{"statementType": "fact", "fact": {"predicate": "is_color", "arguments": ["sky", "blue"]}}\`
3.  **Rule Structure:**
    *   "All humans are mortal." (Given facts use \`is_a(Instance, human)\`) -> \`{"statementType": "rule", "rule": {"head": {"predicate": "mortal", "arguments": ["X"]}, "body": [{"predicate": "is_a", "arguments": ["X", "human"]}]}}\`
    *   "A molecule is composed of atoms." (Rule for query, not for specific molecule composition) -> \`{"statementType": "rule", "rule": {"head": {"predicate": "generally_composed_of", "arguments": ["X", ["atom"]]}, "body": [{"predicate": "is_a", "arguments": ["X", "molecule"]}]}}\` (Using 'generally_composed_of' to distinguish from specific facts like 'is_composed_of(h2o, [hydrogen, oxygen])' to aid query distinction later).
4.  **Specific Instances vs. General Rules:**
    *   "The Moon orbits the Earth." (Specific fact) -> \`{"statementType": "fact", "fact": {"predicate": "orbits", "arguments": ["moon", "earth"]}}\`
    *   "Birds fly." (General rule) -> \`{"statementType": "rule", "rule": {"head": {"predicate": "flies", "arguments": ["X"]}, "body": [{"predicate": "is_a", "arguments": ["X", "bird"]}]}}\` (Assuming 'is_a' for bird type)
- Ensure JSON output is valid and strictly follows the schema. Only output the JSON object.

- If input is too complex/vague for a single SIR fact/rule, output: \`{"error": "Input is too complex or vague for SIR conversion."}\`
- Pay close attention to LEXICON SUMMARY for preferred predicate names and arities.
- For negations (e.g., "Paris is not in Germany."), use \`"isNegative": true\` on the fact: \`{"statementType": "fact", "fact": {"predicate": "is_in", "arguments": ["paris", "germany"], "isNegative": true}}\`.

        *   \`arguments\`: array of strings. Constants (e.g., "socrates") are lowercase_snake_case. Variables (e.g., "X") are ALL_CAPS. For list arguments (e.g. components in a composition), use a JSON array of strings: \`["h2o", ["hydrogen", "oxygen"]]\`.
        *   \`isNegative\` (optional): boolean, defaults to false. Set to true for negated facts (e.g., "Paris is NOT in Germany.").
    *   **Predicate Selection Guide for Facts:**
        *   For class membership (e.g., 'Socrates is a human'): \`"predicate": "is_a", "arguments": ["socrates", "human"]\`
        *   For definitions/identities (e.g., 'Water is H2O'): \`"predicate": "defines", "arguments": ["water", "h2o"]\`
        *   For relational phrases (e.g., 'John is Mary's father'): \`"predicate": "father_of", "arguments": ["john", "mary"]\`
        *   For specific compositions (e.g. 'H2O is composed of Hydrogen and Oxygen'): \`"predicate": "is_composed_of", "arguments": ["h2o", ["hydrogen", "oxygen"]]\`
        *   For simple attributes (e.g., 'The sky is blue'): \`"predicate": "is_color", "arguments": ["sky", "blue"]\`
3.  **If "rule"**:
    *   Include a \`rule\` object.
    *   The \`rule\` object must have:
        *   \`head\`: an object structured like a "fact" (see above), representing the rule's conclusion.
        *   \`body\`: an array of objects, each structured like a "fact", representing the rule's conditions.
    *   **Rule Example:** "All humans are mortal." (Given facts use \`is_a(Instance, human)\`)
        \`"rule": {"head": {"predicate": "mortal", "arguments": ["X"]}, "body": [{"predicate": "is_a", "arguments": ["X", "human"]}]}\`
4.  **Error Handling:**
    *   If input is a question: \`{"error": "Input is a question, not an assertable statement."}\`
    *   If too complex/vague: \`{"error": "Input is too complex or vague for SIR conversion."}\`
