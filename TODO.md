# Model Context Reasoner (MCR) - Future Vision & TODOs

This document outlines "dream big" visions for the Model Context Reasoner, extending beyond immediate next steps to imagine its full potential as a powerful, versatile reasoning service.

## High-Level Vision

MCR evolves into a robust, scalable, and highly extensible "reasoning fabric" that can be seamlessly integrated into any AI application. It becomes the go-to solution for adding sophisticated, stateful, and explainable logical reasoning capabilities, abstracting away the complexities of formal logic and LLM prompting.

## Major Feature Categories & Specific Ideas

### 1. Advanced Reasoning Capabilities

- **Support for Multiple Logic Paradigms:**
  - Beyond Prolog: Integrate Datalog, Answer Set Programming (ASP), or other declarative logic programming languages.
  - Temporal Logic: Enable reasoning about sequences of events and time-based relationships.
  - Probabilistic Reasoning: Integrate probabilistic logic networks or Bayesian inference for uncertain knowledge.
- **Constraint Satisfaction:** Add capabilities for solving constraint satisfaction problems.
- **Explanation Generation:**
  - Generate human-readable explanations for _why_ a certain conclusion was reached (e.g., "X is true because of fact A and rule B").
  - Visualize reasoning paths (e.g., graph-based explanations).
- **Conflict Resolution:** Mechanisms to identify and resolve conflicting facts or rules within a session's knowledge base.
- **Automated Ontology Learning/Refinement:** LLM-driven suggestions for new rules or refinements to existing ontologies based on asserted facts.

### 2. Enhanced LLM Integration & Prompt Engineering

- **Dynamic Prompt Optimization:**
  - Adaptive prompting strategies based on query complexity or session state.
  - Few-shot learning examples dynamically selected from a knowledge base.
- **Multi-Modal Input/Output:**
  - Process facts/queries from images, audio, or video (e.g., "What is happening in this scene?" -> MCR reasons about objects/actions).
  - Generate multi-modal responses (e.g., text + diagram).
- **Fine-tuning Integration:** Support for fine-tuning LLMs specifically for Prolog translation based on user-provided examples.
- **LLM-as-a-Reasoner (Hybrid Approach):** For simpler queries, allow LLMs to directly reason, falling back to Prolog for complex, multi-hop, or highly structured reasoning.
- **Prompt Template Management API:** Allow users to define, store, and manage custom prompt templates for different translation tasks.

### 3. Data Integration & Knowledge Management

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Integration:**
  - Connect to external vector databases or knowledge graphs to retrieve relevant context for LLM translation and Prolog assertions.
  - Dynamic assertion of retrieved facts into the session's knowledge base.
- **Persistent Knowledge Bases:**
  - Beyond in-memory sessions: Options to persist session facts to databases (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, Neo4j for graph-based facts).
  - Ability to load/save entire session states.
- **Knowledge Graph Integration:**
  - Direct integration with graph databases (e.g., Neo4j, RDF stores) for storing and querying facts.
  - Translation between Prolog and graph query languages (e.g., Cypher, SPARQL).
- **External Data Source Connectors:** Built-in connectors to common data sources (APIs, databases, files) to ingest facts.

### 4. Developer Experience & Tooling

- **Comprehensive CLI:**
  - Manage sessions (create, list, delete).
  - Assert facts, run queries directly from the terminal.
  - Import/export sessions.
  - Debug LLM translations and Prolog execution.
- **SDKs (Python, JavaScript, Go, etc.):** Language-specific client libraries for easier integration.
- **Web UI / Playground:**
  - Interactive interface for asserting facts, running queries, and visualizing results.
  - Debugging tools for LLM prompts and Prolog traces.
  - Session management dashboard.
- **Unit Test Framework:** Implement a robust unit testing suite for all core services and API handlers.
- **Demo Framework:** Create a comprehensive demo application showcasing various use cases and API interactions.
- **Observability:**
  - Detailed metrics (request latency, LLM token usage, reasoner execution time).
  - Structured logging for easier debugging and monitoring.
  - Integration with tracing systems (e.g., OpenTelemetry).

### 5. Deployment & Scalability

- **Containerization (Docker):** Provide official Docker images for easy deployment.
- **Cloud Deployment Templates:** Templates for deploying MCR on major cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure).
- **Horizontal Scaling:** Design for statelessness where possible, or distributed session management for high availability and scalability.
- **Performance Optimizations:** Benchmarking and optimization of Prolog execution and LLM interactions.

### 6. Extensibility & Community

- **Plugin Architecture:** Allow users to extend MCR with custom LLM providers, reasoners, or data connectors.
- **Community Ontologies:** A repository of pre-built ontologies for common domains (e.g., medical, legal, finance).
- **Contribution Guidelines:** Clear guidelines for community contributions.

## Immediate Next Steps (from README.md)

- Advanced error handling and debugging to diagnose translation and reasoner issues.
- Prompt template editing and debugging.
- Unit test framework.
  - Investigate and fix phantom `jest/no-standalone-expect` errors in `test/basic.test.js`. (Addressed by moving expects into tests during linting/test refactor)
- Demo framework: try individual operations.
- Extensibility.
- Integrate RAG / datastores through dynamic Prolog assertions / overlay.

# Extended Development Plan

## 1. Build Proof-of-Concept Demo
- Select use case (e.g., technical support chatbot reasoning over FAQs).
- Set up MCR with Prolog and free LLM (e.g., Ollama’s `llama3`).
- Create session, assert facts (e.g., “Product X supports USB-C”), and query (e.g., “Does Product X support USB-C?”).
- Record demo video or script showcasing results.
- Share on GitHub, X, and AI forums (e.g., Reddit’s r/MachineLearning).
- **Considerations**: Keep demo concise; emphasize logical reasoning.

## 2. Enhance Unit Tests
- Review existing unit tests for coverage.
- Add tests for natural language to Prolog translations (e.g., “The sky is blue” to `is_blue(sky).`).
- Include edge cases (e.g., ambiguous sentences, complex queries).
- Run tests after code changes.
- **Considerations**: Use Jest/Mocha; prioritize translation and query endpoints; document tests.

## 3. Implement Semantic Verification
- Extend `POST /translate/nl-to-rules` to generate Prolog facts/rules.
- Add reverse translation via `POST /translate/rules-to-nl`.
- Compare original and round-tripped text for semantic alignment using LLM (e.g., cosine similarity).
- Return confidence score or flag mismatches.
- Integrate as optional flag in assert/query workflows.
- **Considerations**: Use lightweight NLP tools; test varied inputs.

## 4. Abstract for Multiple Logic Engines
- Select second engine (e.g., Datalog or MiniZinc).
- Create abstraction layer for different syntaxes (e.g., `LogicEngine` interface).
- Update translation layer for new engine’s rules.
- Test with Prolog and new engine on same use case.
- Document adding new engines.
- **Considerations**: Start with Datalog; ensure LLM handles new syntaxes; keep Prolog default.

## 5. Develop Self-Development Ontology
- Create “development_workflow” ontology (e.g., `improve(feature, method) :- has_bug(feature), method_solves(method, bug).`).
- Seed with codebase facts (e.g., bugs, metrics).
- Query for inefficiencies (e.g., “What features need optimization?”).
- Assert new rules based on results.
- Test with small code change.
- **Considerations**: Keep rules simple; add safeguards for harmful changes; document ontology.

## 6. Enable Agent Modes
- Design agents: Reasoning (suggests facts/ontologies), Debug (detects issues), Learning (evolves ontologies), Collaboration (shares ontologies).
- Build main loop to trigger API calls based on agent goals.
- Implement Reasoning Agent to monitor queries and suggest facts.
- Test with sample task (e.g., building small ontology).
- **Considerations**: Define clear triggers/goals; start with one agent; ensure logging.

## 7. Build Peer-to-Peer Ontology Network
- Use off-the-shelf DHT (e.g., IPFS, Kademlia) for sharing.
- Modify MCR to publish/fetch ontologies via API endpoints.
- Add sync mechanism for periodic updates.
- Test with two MCR instances sharing ontology (e.g., “common_sense”).
- Implement conflict resolution (e.g., version timestamps).
- **Considerations**: Prioritize security; test scalability; document setup.

## 8. Foster Community Growth
- Open-source on GitHub with readme, setup guide, and demos.
- Share blog post or webinar showing MCR solving problem (e.g., logic puzzle).
- Post on X, Reddit (r/MachineLearning, r/Prolog), and AI communities.
- Encourage contributions via GitHub issues (e.g., “Add logic engine support”).
- Support early adopters while delegating leadership.
- **Considerations**: Use permissive license (e.g., MIT); monitor feedback.

## Implementation Notes
- **Prioritization**: Start with demo and unit tests for stability and visibility, then semantic verification and agent modes for innovation.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Use free tools (Ollama, IPFS, GitHub); iterate incrementally.
- **Community Leverage**: Early community involvement reduces workload.
- **Validation**: Test features with real-world data to ensure relevance.
