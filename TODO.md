# Model Context Reasoner (MCR) - Future Vision & TODOs

This document outlines "dream big" visions for the Model Context Reasoner, extending beyond immediate next steps to imagine its full potential as a powerful, versatile reasoning service.

## High-Level Vision

MCR evolves into a robust, scalable, and highly extensible "reasoning fabric" that can be seamlessly integrated into any AI application. It becomes the go-to solution for adding sophisticated, stateful, and explainable logical reasoning capabilities, abstracting away the complexities of formal logic and LLM prompting.

## Major Feature Categories & Specific Ideas

### 1. Self-Improvement & Metaprogramming (Elegant Dogfooding)

Leveraging MCR's own capabilities (LLM-powered NLP, Prolog reasoning, prompt management) to enhance its development, maintenance, and runtime behavior.

-   **Self-Optimizing Prompt Engineering**: Use MCR's LLM and reasoning services to evaluate and refine its internal prompt templates.
    -   Define a "Prompt Evaluation" ontology (Prolog rules for good translations).
    -   Generate diverse natural language inputs and expected Prolog outputs as test cases.
    -   Implement a self-evaluation loop to compare actual vs. expected output using the evaluation ontology.
    -   Utilize LLM calls to suggest modifications to prompt templates for improved accuracy/conciseness.
-   **Automated Test Case Generation & Validation**: Generate new integration or unit tests for API endpoints or core logic based on high-level natural language descriptions.
    -   Define an API/Logic ontology describing MCR's endpoints, inputs, outputs, and side effects.
    -   Translate natural language test scenarios into Prolog queries against the API/Logic ontology.
    -   Generate actual Jest test code (e.g., `supertest` calls, assertions) from Prolog reasoning.
    -   Implement self-validation by running newly generated tests.
-   **Dynamic Configuration & Feature Toggles via Prolog**: Use Prolog rules to dynamically control aspects of MCR's runtime behavior instead of static configuration.
    -   Define Prolog facts for feature flags (e.g., `feature_enabled(feature_name).`) or routing rules.
    -   Implement runtime evaluation by querying the `reasonerService` to determine behavior.
    -   Allow live updates to MCR's behavior by updating ontologies via the `/ontologies` API.
-   **Self-Documenting API/CLI**: Generate or update MCR's own API reference or CLI usage documentation based on its codebase and defined ontologies.
    -   Create a "code analysis" ontology representing functions, parameters, and descriptions.
    -   Use LLMs (via MCR) to translate Prolog facts into natural language documentation snippets.
-   **Automated Code Generation/Refactoring (Prolog-Driven)**: Automate specific code generation or refactoring tasks.
    -   Define a precise "code representation" ontology for specific code patterns (e.g., new API route, LLM provider integration).
    -   Generate boilerplate or refactor existing code based on Prolog reasoning and LLM output.
    -   Crucially, integrate with automated testing for verification.
-   **Intelligent Error Diagnosis & Self-Healing**: Automatically detect, diagnose, and suggest fixes for common errors.
    -   Define an "error ontology" for common MCR issues (e.g., missing API keys, malformed Prolog).
    -   Implement rules to suggest exact `.env` entries or code modifications for resolution.
-   **Adaptive Prompt Generation (Context-Aware)**: Tailor LLM prompts dynamically based on context.
    -   Develop a "context ontology" (e.g., session fact count, query complexity, LLM model capabilities).
    -   Use Prolog rules to assemble prompts that are optimized for the current context.
-   **Self-Extending Ontology Management**: Allow MCR to assist in creating and maintaining its own ontologies.
    -   Enable LLM-driven generation of new Prolog rules from natural language descriptions.
    -   Implement Prolog-based consistency checks to ensure logical soundness of generated ontologies.

### 2. Advanced Reasoning Capabilities

-   **Support for Multiple Logic Paradigms**: Beyond Prolog: Integrate Datalog, Answer Set Programming (ASP), or other declarative logic programming languages.
-   **Temporal Logic**: Enable reasoning about sequences of events and time-based relationships.
-   **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Integrate probabilistic logic networks or Bayesian inference for uncertain knowledge.
-   **Constraint Satisfaction**: Add capabilities for solving constraint satisfaction problems.
-   **Explanation Generation**:
    -   Generate human-readable explanations for _why_ a certain conclusion was reached (e.g., "X is true because of fact A and rule B").
    -   Visualize reasoning paths (e.g., graph-based explanations).
-   **Conflict Resolution**: Mechanisms to identify and resolve conflicting facts or rules within a session's knowledge base.
-   **Automated Ontology Learning/Refinement**: LLM-driven suggestions for new rules or refinements to existing ontologies based on asserted facts.

### 3. Enhanced LLM Integration & Prompt Engineering

-   **Multi-Modal Input/Output**:
    -   Process facts/queries from images, audio, or video (e.g., "What is happening in this scene?" -> MCR reasons about objects/actions).
    -   Generate multi-modal responses (e.g., text + diagram).
-   **Fine-tuning Integration**: Support for fine-tuning LLMs specifically for Prolog translation based on user-provided examples.
-   **LLM-as-a-Reasoner (Hybrid Approach)**: For simpler queries, allow LLMs to directly reason, falling back to Prolog for complex, multi-hop, or highly structured reasoning.
-   **Prompt Template Management API**: Allow users to define, store, and manage custom prompt templates for different translation tasks.

### 4. Data Integration & Knowledge Management

## Extended Development Plan

### 1. Build Proof-of-Concept Demo

-   Select use case (e.g., technical support chatbot reasoning over FAQs).
-   Set up MCR with Prolog and free LLM (e.g., Ollama’s `llama3`).
-   Create session, assert facts (e.g., “Product X supports USB-C”), and query (e.g., “Does Product X support USB-C?”).
-   Record demo video or script showcasing results.
-   Share on GitHub, X, and AI forums (e.g., Reddit’s r/MachineLearning).
-   **Considerations**: Keep demo concise; emphasize logical reasoning.

### 2. Enhance Unit Tests

-   Review existing unit tests for coverage.
-   Add tests for natural language to Prolog translations (e.g., “The sky is blue” to `is_blue(sky).`).
-   Include edge cases (e.g., ambiguous sentences, complex queries).
-   Run tests after code changes.
-   **Considerations**: Use Jest/Mocha; prioritize translation and query endpoints; document tests.

### 3. Implement Semantic Verification

-   Extend `POST /translate/nl-to-rules` to generate Prolog facts/rules.
-   Add reverse translation via `POST /translate/rules-to-nl`.
-   Compare original and round-tripped text for semantic alignment using LLM (e.g., cosine similarity).
-   Return confidence score or flag mismatches.
-   Integrate as optional flag in assert/query workflows.
-   **Considerations**: Use lightweight NLP tools; test varied inputs.

### 4. Abstract for Multiple Logic Engines

-   Select second engine (e.g., Datalog or MiniZinc).
-   Create abstraction layer for different syntaxes (e.g., `LogicEngine` interface).
-   Update translation layer for new engine’s rules.
-   Test with Prolog and new engine on same use case.
-   Document adding new engines.
-   **Considerations**: Start with Datalog; ensure LLM handles new syntaxes; keep Prolog default.

### 5. Develop Self-Development Ontology

-   Create “development_workflow” ontology (e.g., `improve(feature, method) :- has_bug(feature), method_solves(method, bug).`).
-   Seed with codebase facts (e.g., bugs, metrics).\n-   Query for inefficiencies (e.g., “What features need optimization?”).
-   Assert new rules based on results.
-   Test with small code change.
-   **Considerations**: Keep rules simple; add safeguards for harmful changes; document ontology.

### 6. Enable Agent Modes

-   **DONE: Initial Agent Mode CLI (`mcr-cli agent`)**
    -   Defaults to `gemini-2.5-flash` (configurable via standard MCR LLM env vars).
    -   Asks for Gemini API key if not provided.
    -   Provides a choice of prescripted demos (Simple Q&A, Family Ontology) generating real outputs.
    -   Includes a free chat mode that interacts with MCR's query endpoint.
    -   Clearly shows API interactions, NL-to-Prolog translations, and Prolog outputs.
    -   Loops allowing the user to try another demo or exit.
-   Design other agents: Reasoning (suggests facts/ontologies), Debug (detects issues), Learning (evolves ontologies), Collaboration (shares ontologies).
-   Build main loop to trigger API calls based on _specific agent goals_ (beyond current demo/chat loop).
-   Implement Reasoning Agent to monitor queries and suggest facts.
-   Test with sample task (e.g., building small ontology).
-   **Considerations**: Define clear triggers/goals for more advanced agents; ensure logging.

### 7. Build Peer-to-Peer Ontology Network
