# Model Context Reasoner (MCR) - Future Vision & TODOs

This document outlines a "dream big" vision for the Model Context Reasoner, extending beyond immediate next steps to imagine its full potential as a powerful, versatile reasoning service.

## High-Level Vision

MCR evolves into a robust, scalable, and highly extensible "reasoning fabric" that can be seamlessly integrated into any AI application. It becomes the go-to solution for adding sophisticated, stateful, and explainable logical reasoning capabilities, abstracting away the complexities of formal logic and LLM prompting.

## Major Feature Categories & Specific Ideas

### 1. Advanced Reasoning Capabilities

*   **Support for Multiple Logic Paradigms:**
    *   Beyond Prolog: Integrate Datalog, Answer Set Programming (ASP), or other declarative logic programming languages.
    *   Temporal Logic: Enable reasoning about sequences of events and time-based relationships.
    *   Probabilistic Reasoning: Integrate probabilistic logic networks or Bayesian inference for uncertain knowledge.
*   **Constraint Satisfaction:** Add capabilities for solving constraint satisfaction problems.
*   **Explanation Generation:**
    *   Generate human-readable explanations for *why* a certain conclusion was reached (e.g., "X is true because of fact A and rule B").
    *   Visualize reasoning paths (e.g., graph-based explanations).
*   **Conflict Resolution:** Mechanisms to identify and resolve conflicting facts or rules within a session's knowledge base.
*   **Automated Ontology Learning/Refinement:** LLM-driven suggestions for new rules or refinements to existing ontologies based on asserted facts.

### 2. Enhanced LLM Integration & Prompt Engineering

*   **Dynamic Prompt Optimization:**
    *   Adaptive prompting strategies based on query complexity or session state.
    *   Few-shot learning examples dynamically selected from a knowledge base.
*   **Multi-Modal Input/Output:**
    *   Process facts/queries from images, audio, or video (e.g., "What is happening in this scene?" -> MCR reasons about objects/actions).
    *   Generate multi-modal responses (e.g., text + diagram).
*   **Fine-tuning Integration:** Support for fine-tuning LLMs specifically for Prolog translation based on user-provided examples.
*   **LLM-as-a-Reasoner (Hybrid Approach):** For simpler queries, allow LLMs to directly reason, falling back to Prolog for complex, multi-hop, or highly structured reasoning.
*   **Prompt Template Management API:** Allow users to define, store, and manage custom prompt templates for different translation tasks.

### 3. Data Integration & Knowledge Management

*   **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Integration:**
    *   Connect to external vector databases or knowledge graphs to retrieve relevant context for LLM translation and Prolog assertions.
    *   Dynamic assertion of retrieved facts into the session's knowledge base.
*   **Persistent Knowledge Bases:**
    *   Beyond in-memory sessions: Options to persist session facts to databases (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, Neo4j for graph-based facts).
    *   Ability to load/save entire session states.
*   **Knowledge Graph Integration:**
    *   Direct integration with graph databases (e.g., Neo4j, RDF stores) for storing and querying facts.
    *   Translation between Prolog and graph query languages (e.g., Cypher, SPARQL).
*   **External Data Source Connectors:** Built-in connectors to common data sources (APIs, databases, files) to ingest facts.

### 4. Developer Experience & Tooling

*   **Comprehensive CLI:**
    *   Manage sessions (create, list, delete).
    *   Assert facts, run queries directly from the terminal.
    *   Import/export sessions.
    *   Debug LLM translations and Prolog execution.
*   **SDKs (Python, JavaScript, Go, etc.):** Language-specific client libraries for easier integration.
*   **Web UI / Playground:**
    *   Interactive interface for asserting facts, running queries, and visualizing results.
    *   Debugging tools for LLM prompts and Prolog traces.
    *   Session management dashboard.
*   **Unit Test Framework:** Implement a robust unit testing suite for all core services and API handlers.
*   **Demo Framework:** Create a comprehensive demo application showcasing various use cases and API interactions.
*   **Observability:**
    *   Detailed metrics (request latency, LLM token usage, reasoner execution time).
    *   Structured logging for easier debugging and monitoring.
    *   Integration with tracing systems (e.g., OpenTelemetry).

### 5. Deployment & Scalability

*   **Containerization (Docker):** Provide official Docker images for easy deployment.
*   **Cloud Deployment Templates:** Templates for deploying MCR on major cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure).
*   **Horizontal Scaling:** Design for statelessness where possible, or distributed session management for high availability and scalability.
*   **Performance Optimizations:** Benchmarking and optimization of Prolog execution and LLM interactions.

### 6. Extensibility & Community

*   **Plugin Architecture:** Allow users to extend MCR with custom LLM providers, reasoners, or data connectors.
*   **Community Ontologies:** A repository of pre-built ontologies for common domains (e.g., medical, legal, finance).
*   **Contribution Guidelines:** Clear guidelines for community contributions.

## Immediate Next Steps (from README.md)

*   Advanced error handling and debugging to diagnose translation and reasoner issues.
*   Prompt template editing and debugging.
*   Unit test framework.
*   Demo framework: try individual operations.
*   Extensibility.
*   Integrate RAG / datastores through dynamic Prolog assertions / overlay.
