# Model Context Reasoner (MCR) - Future Vision & TODOs

This document outlines "dream big" visions for the Model Context Reasoner, extending beyond immediate next steps to imagine its full potential as a powerful, versatile reasoning service.

## High-Level Vision

MCR evolves into a robust, scalable, and highly extensible "reasoning fabric" that can be seamlessly integrated into any AI application. It becomes the go-to solution for adding sophisticated, stateful, and explainable logical reasoning capabilities, abstracting away the complexities of formal logic and LLM prompting.

## Major Feature Categories & Specific Ideas

### 1. Self-Improvement & Metaprogramming (Elegant Dogfooding)

Leveraging MCR's own capabilities (LLM-powered NLP, Prolog reasoning, prompt management) to enhance its development, maintenance, and runtime behavior.

- **Self-Optimizing Prompt Engineering**: Use MCR's LLM and reasoning services to evaluate and refine its internal prompt templates.
  - Define a "Prompt Evaluation" ontology (Prolog rules for good translations).
  - Generate diverse natural language inputs and expected Prolog outputs as test cases.
  - Implement a self-evaluation loop to compare actual vs. expected output using the evaluation ontology.
  - Utilize LLM calls to suggest modifications to prompt templates for improved accuracy/conciseness.
- **Automated Test Case Generation & Validation**: Generate new integration or unit tests for API endpoints or core logic based on high-level natural language descriptions.
  - Define an API/Logic ontology describing MCR's endpoints, inputs, outputs, and side effects.
  - Translate natural language test scenarios into Prolog queries against the API/Logic ontology.
  - Generate actual Jest test code (e.g., `supertest` calls, assertions) from Prolog reasoning.
  - Implement self-validation by running newly generated tests.
- **Dynamic Configuration & Feature Toggles via Prolog**: Use Prolog rules to dynamically control aspects of MCR's runtime behavior instead of static configuration.
  - Define Prolog facts for feature flags (e.g., `feature_enabled(feature_name).`) or routing rules.
  - Implement runtime evaluation by querying the `reasonerService` to determine behavior.
  - Allow live updates to MCR's behavior by updating ontologies via the `/ontologies` API.
- **Self-Documenting API/CLI**: Generate or update MCR's own API reference or CLI usage documentation based on its codebase and defined ontologies.
  - Create a "code analysis" ontology representing functions, parameters, and descriptions.
  - Use LLMs (via MCR) to translate Prolog facts into natural language documentation snippets.
- **Automated Code Generation/Refactoring (Prolog-Driven)**: Automate specific code generation or refactoring tasks.
  - Define a precise "code representation" ontology for specific code patterns (e.g., new API route, LLM provider integration).
  - Generate boilerplate or refactor existing code based on Prolog reasoning and LLM output.
  - Crucially, integrate with automated testing for verification.
- **Intelligent Error Diagnosis & Self-Healing**: Automatically detect, diagnose, and suggest fixes for common errors.
  - Define an "error ontology" for common MCR issues (e.g., missing API keys, malformed Prolog).
  - Implement rules to suggest exact `.env` entries or code modifications for resolution.
- **Adaptive Prompt Generation (Context-Aware)**: Tailor LLM prompts dynamically based on context.
  - Develop a "context ontology" (e.g., session fact count, query complexity, LLM model capabilities).
  - Use Prolog rules to assemble prompts that are optimized for the current context.
- **Self-Extending Ontology Management**: Allow MCR to assist in creating and maintaining its own ontologies.
  - Enable LLM-driven generation of new Prolog rules from natural language descriptions.
  - Implement Prolog-based consistency checks to ensure logical soundness of generated ontologies.

### 2. Advanced Reasoning Capabilities

- **Support for Multiple Logic Paradigms**: Beyond Prolog: Integrate Datalog, Answer Set Programming (ASP), or other declarative logic programming languages.
- **Temporal Logic**: Enable reasoning about sequences of events and time-based relationships.
- **Probabilistic Reasoning**: Integrate probabilistic logic networks or Bayesian inference for uncertain knowledge.
- **Constraint Satisfaction**: Add capabilities for solving constraint satisfaction problems.
- **Explanation Generation**:
  - Generate human-readable explanations for _why_ a certain conclusion was reached (e.g., "X is true because of fact A and rule B").
  - Visualize reasoning paths (e.g., graph-based explanations).
- **Conflict Resolution**: Mechanisms to identify and resolve conflicting facts or rules within a session's knowledge base.
- **Automated Ontology Learning/Refinement**: LLM-driven suggestions for new rules or refinements to existing ontologies based on asserted facts.

### 3. Enhanced LLM Integration & Prompt Engineering

- **Multi-Modal Input/Output**:
  - Process facts/queries from images, audio, or video (e.g., "What is happening in this scene?" -> MCR reasons about objects/actions).
  - Generate multi-modal responses (e.g., text + diagram).
- **Fine-tuning Integration**: Support for fine-tuning LLMs specifically for Prolog translation based on user-provided examples.
- **LLM-as-a-Reasoner (Hybrid Approach)**: For simpler queries, allow LLMs to directly reason, falling back to Prolog for complex, multi-hop, or highly structured reasoning.
- **Prompt Template Management API**: Allow users to define, store, and manage custom prompt templates for different translation tasks.

### 4. Data Integration & Knowledge Management

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Integration**:
  - Connect to external vector databases or knowledge graphs to retrieve relevant context for LLM translation and Prolog assertions.
  - Dynamic assertion of retrieved facts into the session's knowledge base.

- **Contribution Guidelines**: Clear guidelines for community contributions (`CONTRIBUTING.md`).

## Short-Term Focus Areas (Refined from previous "Immediate Next Steps")

- **Enhanced Error Handling & Debugging**: Improve diagnostics for translation and reasoner issues, making it easier for users to understand and resolve problems. (Corresponds to current plan)
- **User-Friendly Prompt Management**: While prompt debugging tools exist (`/debug-prompt`, `/debug/format-prompt`), explore ways to make viewing and understanding the core prompts more accessible to users who want to "look under the hood". Full editing is a larger feature.
- **Comprehensive Unit & Integration Testing**: Continue to build out the test suite (Jest is set up) to cover more core functionalities, edge cases, and API endpoints. (Corresponds to current plan)
- **Streamlined Demo and Exploration Tools**: The `mcr demo run` command and TUI provide good exploration capabilities. Ensure these are robust and showcase features effectively.
- **Refine RAG/Dynamic Knowledge Documentation**: Ensure the existing mechanism for RAG via dynamic `ontology` injection in queries is clearly documented and its potential highlighted. Direct datastore connectors are a larger future item.
- **CLI & TUI Polish**: Continue to refine the CLI and TUI for usability, clear output, and robust error handling. (Corresponds to current plan)

## Extended Development Plan

### 1. Build Proof-of-Concept Demo

- Select use case (e.g., technical support chatbot reasoning over FAQs).
- Set up MCR with Prolog and free LLM (e.g., Ollama’s `llama3`).
- Create session, assert facts (e.g., “Product X supports USB-C”), and query (e.g., “Does Product X support USB-C?”).
- Record demo video or script showcasing results.
- Share on GitHub, X, and AI forums (e.g., Reddit’s r/MachineLearning).
- **Considerations**: Keep demo concise; emphasize logical reasoning.

### 2. Enhance Unit Tests

- Review existing unit tests for coverage.
- Add tests for natural language to Prolog translations (e.g., “The sky is blue” to `is_blue(sky).`).
- Include edge cases (e.g., ambiguous sentences, complex queries).
- Run tests after code changes.
- **Considerations**: Use Jest/Mocha; prioritize translation and query endpoints; document tests.

### 3. Implement Semantic Verification

- Extend `POST /translate/nl-to-rules` to generate Prolog facts/rules.
- Add reverse translation via `POST /translate/rules-to-nl`.
- Compare original and round-tripped text for semantic alignment using LLM (e.g., cosine similarity).
- Return confidence score or flag mismatches.
- Integrate as optional flag in assert/query workflows.
- **Considerations**: Use lightweight NLP tools; test varied inputs.

### 4. Abstract for Multiple Logic Engines

- Select second engine (e.g., Datalog or MiniZinc).
- Create abstraction layer for different syntaxes (e.g., `LogicEngine` interface).
- Update translation layer for new engine’s rules.
- Test with Prolog and new engine on same use case.
- Document adding new engines.
- **Considerations**: Start with Datalog; ensure LLM handles new syntaxes; keep Prolog default.

### 5. Develop Self-Development Ontology

- Create “development_workflow” ontology (e.g., `improve(feature, method) :- has_bug(feature), method_solves(method, bug).`).
- Seed with codebase facts (e.g., bugs, metrics).\n- Query for inefficiencies (e.g., “What features need optimization?”).
- Assert new rules based on results.
- Test with small code change.
- **Considerations**: Keep rules simple; add safeguards for harmful changes; document ontology.

### 6. Enable Agent Modes

- **Interactive Exploration (Current):** The `mcr chat` and `mcr sandbox` commands provide interactive modes for users to act as "agents" guiding the reasoning process.
- **Future Agent Concepts:**
  - Design specialized agents: e.g., a "Reasoning Agent" that proactively suggests relevant facts or ontologies based on query patterns, a "Debugging Agent" that helps diagnose complex issues, or a "Learning Agent" that evolves ontologies over time.
  - These would likely involve a main loop triggering API calls based on specific agent goals, going beyond the current interactive demo/chat/sandbox loops.
  - An initial step could be to implement a "Reasoning Agent" that monitors queries and suggests related facts from a broader knowledge base or common sense ontology.
- **Considerations**: Define clear triggers, goals, and operational loops for more advanced automated agents; ensure robust logging and user oversight.

### 7. Build Peer-to-Peer Ontology Network

- Use off-the-shelf DHT (e.g., IPFS, Kademlia) for sharing.
- Modify MCR to publish/fetch ontologies via API endpoints.
- Add sync mechanism for periodic updates.
- Test with two MCR instances sharing ontology (e.g., “common_sense”).
- Implement conflict resolution (e.g., version timestamps).
- **Considerations**: Prioritize security; test scalability; document setup.

### 8. Foster Community Growth

- Open-source on GitHub with readme, setup guide, and demos.
- Share blog post or webinar showing MCR solving problem (e.g., logic puzzle).
- Post on X, Reddit (r/MachineLearning, r/Prolog), and AI communities.
- Encourage contributions via GitHub issues (e.g., “Add logic engine support”).
- Support early adopters while delegating leadership.
- **Considerations**: Use permissive license (e.g., MIT); monitor feedback.

## Implementation Notes

- **Prioritization**: Start with demo and unit tests for stability and visibility, then semantic verification and agent modes for innovation.
- **Resource Efficiency**: Use free tools (Ollama, IPFS, GitHub); iterate incrementally.
- **Community Leverage**: Early community involvement reduces workload.
- **Validation**: Test features with real-world data to ensure relevance.
